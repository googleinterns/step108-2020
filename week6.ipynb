By only inserting the game if the team won, we ensure that we don't duplicate any entries. When considering a given game, we will use the `BoxScorePlayerTrackV2` endpoint, which takes in a `GAME_ID` and returns the boxscore, to get the list of players who played at least 3 minutes on each team.

    "Cool! Now we have our `record` which is a table that contains all the data we need. Unfortunately, a machine learning algorithm cannot take this as an input. We need to [one-hot encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot) our data, secifically, using the Python methods describe [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-one-hot-encode-sequence-data-in-python/). This means we will have to create a column for every player, whose value will be 1 if the player was in the game and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, here we run into our first issue. If we just create a single column for each player, the algorithm will have no way of knowing who was on what team. Therefore, we need to create two columns for each player (e.g., for LeBron James, we have columns `LeBronJames_A` and `LeBronJames_B`). So, now we can make one of the teams A, and one of the teams B. However, we need to make sure that we don't, for example, encode the winning team as team A always. Otherwise, the ML algorithm will think that being team A is what makes you win, instead of seeing how individual players affect the chance of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we can solve this issue is by creating two entries for each game. We can encode (Winning Team -> A, Losing Team -> B) + make it a positive training example (i.e. 1), and then make an entry for the reverse, encoding (Winning Team -> B, Losing Team -> A) + make it a negative training example (i.e. 0). This way, the algorithm won't correlate being team A or team B with winning. This way, when we use the algorithm for inference, we can log the teams in arbitrary order without having to worry about who is A or who is B."

Additionally, we will pickle this new dataframe since the method above takes a while to finish.  "
