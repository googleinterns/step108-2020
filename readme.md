Hello! You may be wondering, what is [ball.ai]([https://bj-de-jw-step-2020.uc.r.appspot.com/](https://bj-de-jw-step-2020.uc.r.appspot.com/))? In terms of what it actually is, it's the world's first fantasy basketball engine, a unified solution for any time you've asked yourself a question about an impossible basketball scenario. If you've ever wondered just how overpowered the 2018 Warriors would have been if they had LeBron James on their team, or what would have happened if Michael Jordan had joined the Nets instead of the Wizards in 2002, ball.ai is the place for you. 

In terms of why we (developers Diego Escobedo, Brandon Jones, and Jeremy Weiss) did it, the answer is that it is the capstone for our Google STEP internship. Typically, STEP interns would work on the same area as their host, aiming to develop a feature that would become part of the product. Unfortunately, due to the fact that COVID-19 forced the internship online, this meant that giving interns access to Google's codebase was no longer feasible from a securitry perspective. So, as STEP interns, we were tasked with making an entire website from scratch. For those of us who hadn't done webdev before, this was obviously challenging, but it was a great learning experience, and we hope you enjoy it! Below is a quick summary of everyone's feature, and then within each folder you can find more details about everyone's work.
